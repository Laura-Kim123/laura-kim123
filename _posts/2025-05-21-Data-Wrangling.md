## What is Data Wrangling?

Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a usable format for analysis. This step is essential in the data science workflow because real-world data is often messy, incomplete, or inconsistent.

### Key Steps in Data Wrangling

- **Data Collection:** Gathering data from different sources.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
- **Data Transformation:** Converting data types, normalizing values, and creating new features.
- **Data Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset.
- **Data Validation:** Ensuring the data is accurate and ready for analysis.

### Why is Data Wrangling Important?

Proper data wrangling ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate, consistent, and reliable. It helps analysts and data scientists make better decisions and build more effective models.
